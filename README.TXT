PROJECT TITLE: SortProblem
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To observe various sorting algorithms on different types of ordered,reversed, or random arrays of integers to view amount of comparisons and exchanges each algorithm makes.
VERSION or DATE: 6/3/21
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the RandomFileGenerator method to create text files of different arrays (ordered, random, and reverse) then run "SortProblem" class to use those files and view comparisons and exchanges. Different sorting algorithms are currently commented out so to switch between them, simply comment out the ones that aren't in use. I am aware that this is not an optimal way to do this.
